This project details the creation of the "Alpine Life" Solana token in a containerized environment.  Currently creating the documentation that describes the step-by-step process to accomplish this.  For now, here is a link to the token on solscan.io - If interested in getting some free Alpine Life tokens hit me up and you got it!  Although I should add the caveat that it is completely worthless.lol
